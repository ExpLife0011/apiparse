  To be able to replay the trace proper lifetime management should
be employed. Right now release calls are omited. Should omit AddRef also.
  All the objects for a trace can be created beforehand.
Only Map/Unmap, UpdateSubresource and Drawcalls should be replayed.
Need to generate classification and reflection mechanism.

First step is to change:
getInterface<ID3D11Device>(0x0000025D7C250F70)->CreateBuffer(...);
Into this:
ID3D11Device_CreateBuffer(getInterface<ID3D11Device>(0x0000025D7C250F70), ...);
Inside this wrapper, some dependency calculation could be done.

Substitute device and swapchain in the stream

160k lines take too long to compile

Remove useless functions

Improve compile time:
  split source and table

Wrapper function:
  check arguments
  add dependency information
  marshall arguments
  validate result

Improve debugging:
  lifetime checks
  return code checks
  out of bound access for serialized data
  nested pointer checks for serialized data
    clang tool can provide info on nested data structures

Next commit:

Omit from cppgen: - soon all adapter functions will be removed 
	AddRef
	ClearState
	Flush
	SetFullscreenState
	CheckFeatureSupport
	GetDisplayModeList
	ResizeBuffers

Fix for(int i ... ) -> for(uint32_t i ...)
Change .SysMemSlicePitch -> desc->Height * pSubres[subresId].SysMemPitch
	Is it right?

Proper handling of ClearRenderTargetView
Blob alignment
